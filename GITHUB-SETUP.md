git push -u origin main
```

### 3. Repository Settings Configuration

#### Branch Protection (Recommended)
1. Go to repository ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Branches
2. Click "Add rule"
3. Branch name pattern: `main`
4. Enable:
   - ‚úÖ Require pull request reviews before merging

   - ‚úÖ Require branches to be up to date before merging

#### Pages Setup
1. Go to repository ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Pages
2. Source: "GitHub Actions"
3. This will allow the deployment workflow to publish the site

### 4. Automated Deployment Setup

Create GitHub Actions workflow for automatic deployment:

```bash
mkdir -p .github/workflows
```

Create `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`:

```yaml
name: Deploy Spexop.com to GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]
  workflow_dispatch:

permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write

concurrency:
  group: "pages"
  cancel-in-progress: true

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        
      - name: Setup pnpm
        uses: pnpm/action-setup@v2
        with:
          version: 8
          
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 18
          cache: 'pnpm'
          
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
        
      - name: Build website
        run: pnpm build
        
      - name: Upload artifact
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
        with:
          path: ./out

  deploy:
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        id: deployment
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
```

Commit and push the workflow:

```bash
git add .github/workflows/deploy.yml
git commit -m "Add GitHub Actions deployment workflow"
git push origin main
```
